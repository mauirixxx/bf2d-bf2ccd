# bf2d-bf2ccd

Working on a "simple" shell script to automate installing a Linux based Battlefield 2 server with BF2CCD for easy admin.

Please note, this installs a VERY old version of mono, which may be terribly insecure at this point - 10 years later. Beware.

Easy install: curl -s https://www.fullcontactwar.com/files/install_bf2d_bf2ccd.sh | sudo bash

THere's still issues with opening the firewall ports :(
